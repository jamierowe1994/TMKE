// TMKE — branded starter email templates.
// A springboard set for the marketing team: minimal, polished, on-brand. Each
// uses the house palette, the serif wordmark header (auto, from the shell), one
// R2 stock image, merge fields, and a footer. Seeded from /admin/email.
// These are drafts — staff edit and adjust freely.

// Confirmed public R2 stock images.
